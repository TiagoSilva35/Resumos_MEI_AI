- ### O que s√£o? #card
	- "Advanced persistent threats (APT) are undetected cyberattacks designed to steal sensitive data, conduct cyber espionage or sabotage  critical systems over a long period of time. Unlike other cyberthreats such as ransomware the goal of an APT attack group is to remain unnoticed as it infiltrates and expands its presence across a target network."
